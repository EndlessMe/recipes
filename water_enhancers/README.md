# Water Electrolyte Enhancer

---

## Ingredients

- A **pinch** of **Borax** (literally from that "20 Mule Team" box in the laundry detergent aisle), **Magnesium** (Epsom Salt), **Baking Soda**, **Potassium** (No Salt), and **Himalayan Pink Salt**. Remember: A **pinch**. no more!

## Optional

- Some sort of flavor enhancer, such as **Propel** or **Mio**. **Make sure it is sugar free**! This is to remove the salt water taste from the water.

## Recipe

Add ingredients to water, preferably  1 Liter of water (about 32 Fluid Ounces), shake/stir, and drink throughout the day. If you are mixing with less water, drink additional water after consuming.
